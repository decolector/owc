# Workshop proposals

In this document I propose several Workshops that can take place here In January 2015.

## Creative Coding in Processing

### Introduction

Computer programming is not only a way to create software that solves a problem or carry out a practical task, it can also be a medium for art and creative expression.  Creative coding is a term recently coined to name several practices in which computer science, and more specifically, and programming are used in a creative and imaginative ways.

### Description

The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamental concepts and tools to write computer programs and use this abilities to create  visual or audible compositions, interactive applications and other forms of digital artworks.


### Methodology

The workshop will be composed of practical sessions where we will learn the basic concepts of computer programming through practical lessons and working examples.  At the end we will develop our own work, building up from the scratch or from other people's code.  All examples for this workshops will be hosted in this repository.

### Tools

We'll use the [processing](https://processing.org/) language and programming environment, which is an open source tool for visual and interactive programming.  It can be installed on a computer running [OSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) or [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) platforms.

### Duration

9 hours ( 3 sessions of 3 hours each )

## DIY Electronics with Arduino

### Introduction

The world of digital electronics is not exclusive to Engineers anymore, there are several ways in which we can appropiate and experiment with this technology to develop devices that integrate into our environment, but also to develop proyects just for fun.

### Description

[Arduino](http://arduino.cc) is a platform composed of the Arduino [microcontroller board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_microcontroller) and the Arduino [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). It was created as a prototyping tool for artists and designers, but it has spread out to other contexts like [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) and [Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) subculture.

### Methodology

We will develop simple electronic devices using easy-to-use components. In the process we'll learn basic concepts from digital electronics like voltage, transduction, sensors, actuators and the basics of programming microcontrollers.  At the end of the workshop we can extend the examples and experiment a bit more.

### Tools

* Ardiuino uno microcontroller board
* A small set of sensors ( to define )
* A small set of actuators ( to define )
* A small set of electronic component ( to define )
* Soldier Breadeboard

### Duration

12 hours ( 4 sessions 3 hours or 3 sessions 4 hours)
