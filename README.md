# One World Center Residency Program

I consider my stay at [One World Center Michigan](http://oneworldcenter.org) an informal residency period where I exchange ideas, knowledge an experiences with the people here.  I want this to be a time to develop my own work (both technical and creative ) and at the same time I want to find a way my work can dialogue with the ongoing (social, economic, cultural) processes that are unfolding in this community.

## Evening Program

Surprise !!

The evening program is a series of activities that happen every weekday from 7:30 to 8:30 (roughly). I'm proposing one for Tuesday, December 22, 2015.

The content of this activity is classified until it's date and time.

## Workshops

I'm proposing several workshops for the community.  They are described [here](workshops/proposal.md)
